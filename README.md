Project Title: Using AI Assistants to Encourage Sustainable Behaviors

Overview: This project will develop AI chatbot agents that can have natural conversations with people to educate them about sustainability and encourage more environmentally friendly actions in their daily lives. The chatbots will be optimized for empathetic dialogue and providing personalized recommendations tailored to the user's specific contexts and motivations.

Technical Approach:

- Develop a knowledge base of sustainability topics and environmentally friendly actions across areas like energy use, transportation, food, recycling, etc. This will require extensive research into sustainability best practices.

- Create conversation templates for common scenarios like providing tips to reduce home energy use, suggesting taking public transit or carpooling instead of driving solo, helping meal plan to reduce food waste, etc. 

- Build a robust conversational interface that people can interact with via voice or text on platforms like mobile apps, smart speakers, websites, etc. 

- Analyze conversation logs to continuously improve the chatbots' knowledge and conversational abilities.

Impact Potential:

- Provide a scalable, personalized way to educate the public on sustainability and drive adoption of environmentally friendly actions. 

- Chatbots can reach people at scale and engage at the right moments to encourage sustainable practices.

- Reduced carbon footprint and resource consumption by shifting individuals' behaviors over time.

- Quantifiable sustainability impact can be estimated by tracking metrics like energy use, miles driven, dollars donated, etc. before and after chatbot interactions.
